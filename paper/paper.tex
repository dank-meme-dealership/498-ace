\title{Arbitrary Code Execution}
\author{ROGER OGDEN AND BRIK ROYSTER}

\begin{abstract}
Arbitrary code execution is the process by which a program can be compromised, allowing a user to execute code that is not part of the binary currently executing, and is a relevant topic in software security. We present several examples of what arbitrary code execution looks like, and how it's used, including buffer overflow, Dirty COW, and its use in Super Mario World. We show that arbitrary code execution exists in many forms, and isn't always used for malicious purposes, though the large majority is.
